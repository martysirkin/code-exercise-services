# Product Information Ingestion Library

## Overview

Swiftly needs to integrate with a grocery store's product information system so our system can stay current with the store's product inventory and pricing.  Another dev will be responsible for ingesting the files and passing their contents to the processing library you create based on the requirements below.

![Product Information Integration Architecture](https://github.com/prestoqinc/code-exercise-services/raw/master/Swiftly_Services_Coding_Exercise_Architecture.png "Product Information Integration Architecture")

## Requirements
Each store in a grocery chain has its own product catalog service
* Changes to product information are published to our integration service using a fixed-width flat file format defined by the store’s point of sale system (specifications below)
* The store publishes update journal files at most every 60 seconds

*Input*: Store product catalog information<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>. You can assume that this is a formal third-party API contract that has been rigorously validated and if there are any lines that don't adhere to the schema, they can be skipped.

*Output*: A collection of _ProductRecord_ objects<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>

## Input Data Format
The file is in an ASCII-encoded flat file (fixed width) format. For this first phase of the project, you only need to ingest the first 10 fields of the record. There are actually several hundred fields that you'll add to the data model once you've circled back with the team on this first phase and there's consensus on the pattern you introduce. Here's the schema of the first 10 fields:

| Start | End [Inclusive] | Name                       | Type     |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------------|----------|
| 1     | 8               | Product ID                 | Number   |
| 10    | 68              | Product Description        | String   |
| 70    | 77              | Regular Singular Price     | Currency |
| 79    | 86              | Promotional Singular Price | Currency |
| 88    | 95              | Regular Split Price        | Currency |
| 97    | 104             | Promotional Split Price    | Currency |
| 106   | 113             | Regular For X              | Number   |
| 115   | 122             | Promotional For X          | Number   |
| 124   | 132             | Flags                      | Flags    |
| 134   | 142             | Product Size               | String   |
...

### Field Data Types
* Number - an integer value 8-digits long, zero left-padded
* String - ASCII encoded string, space right-or-left-padded
* Currency - US dollar value, where last two digits represent cents.  The leading zero will be replaced with a dash if the value is negative
* Flag - Y/N

### Pricing Information
* Prices can either be a singular price per unit (e.g. $1.00) or a split price (e.g. 2 for $0.99). Only one price (singluar or split) per price level (regular or promotional) will exist. The price data for an undefined price will be all 0's.
* If a price is split pricing, the Calculator Price is Split Price / For X
* You can be guaranteed that the input file will follow these rules – consider it a contract that the producer will always abide by.  No error checking is required for this first stage.

### Flags
The first flag in the left-to-right array is #1
* If Flag #3 is set, this is a per-weight item
* If Flag #5 is set, the item is taxable.  Tax rate is always 7.775%

## ProductRecord object should contain at a minimum:
* Product ID
* Product Description
* Regular Display Price (English-readable string of your choosing, e.g. "$1.00" or "3 for $1.00")
* Regular Calculator Price (price the calculator should use, rounded to 4 decimal places, half-down)
* Promotional Display Price, if it exists (same format as regular display price string)
* Promotional Calculator Price, if it exists
* Unit of Measure ("Each" or "Pound").  Weighted items are per pound
* Product size
* Tax rate
